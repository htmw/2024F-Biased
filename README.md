# Project Description

SkinLens is a web-based platform designed to provide fast and accurate diagnoses for skin conditions using deep learning. The platform is intended for patients who want quick access to their diagnosis and treatment recommendations, as well as for dermatologists who need efficient access to patient reports. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on visual inspections, SkinLens utilizes an advanced image-based deep learning model to offer precise predictions and treatment suggestions. One of the key features is real-time consultation with dermatologists, allowing patients to receive personalized care directly through the platform. SkinLens offers several benefits, including improved diagnostic accuracy, faster and more personalized care, greater accessibility, cost reduction, and real-time access to professional consultations
